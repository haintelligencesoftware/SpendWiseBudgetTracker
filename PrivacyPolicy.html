        <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>SpendWise Budget Tracker</strong> app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by <strong>Vedat KOÇYİĞİT</strong> (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>
      </section>

      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Application does <strong>not</strong> gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

      <p class="muted">The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.</p>

      <p>For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider request will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.</p>

      <h2>Third Party Access</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</li>

The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission.
